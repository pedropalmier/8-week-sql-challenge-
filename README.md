# 🏃🏻‍♂️‍➡️ 🗓️ 8 Week SQL Challenge
This repository contains my solutions for the [8 Week SQL Challenge](https://8weeksqlchallenge.com/), in which many different databases were made available and the goal was to explore and to solve business problems with SQL language. In this case, I chose to solve the challenges with PostgreSQL.
